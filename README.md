# cinema-squeeze

This project is a full-stack web application designed to help users compare movie ticket prices from two independent providers ‚Äî **Cinemaworld** and **Filmworld** ‚Äî and identify the **cheapest available option**. The application is built with a strong emphasis on **resilience**, **user experience**, and **code quality**, reflecting a real-world scenario where third-party APIs can be unreliable or partially unavailable.

The goal is to deliver a responsive, user-friendly interface where users can:

- View a catalog of available movies.
- Compare ticket prices from both providers.
- Clearly identify the **lowest price** for each movie.
- View more details or proceed to buy a ticket (simulated).

### üí° Key Features

- **Robust error handling**: Ensures the application remains functional even if one or both provider APIs fail or return incomplete data.
- **Backend caching**: Movie data is fetched and stored using **Cron job** with Redis to reduce dependency on real-time API responses and improve performance.
- **Secure token handling**: API tokens are stored securely using `.NET` **Secret Manager** best practices to prevent public exposure.
- **Seamless frontend experience**: Built with `Next.js` and `Tailwind CSS`, offering a modern, responsive UI with a focus on accessibility and performance.
- **Scalable architecture**: Designed to easily extend support for additional movie providers or future enhancements.
- **Search more**: User can search movie by keyword like tile, genre etc.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core Web API
- **Caching**: Redis (local docker)
- **Communication**: RESTful APIs
- **Configuration**: `appsettings.json` and environment variables for managing secrets/API token
